problem statement:- Monitor httpd server with the help of cloudwatchlogs

Basic idea:- 1)access_logs ----- a file of httpd web server which describe how application is running
	  2)Error_log--------a file of httpd web server which describes the errors occured in application
	  3)awslogsd---- it is a monitoring agent of aws which is use to live monitoring of httpd

Practical:- 1)install httpd and host a file 
		yum install httpd -y
		cd /var/www/html
		vi index.html ------ "This is my webapplication hosted on httpd server"  
		Open port 80 in security grp
		service httpd start
	2)install log agent
		yum install awslogs -y
		service awslogsd start
	3)Create IAM role and attac it to Ec2 instance where application is hosted on httpd and generate the logs with the help of cloudwatchlogs
		In IAM select Role
			--->create role
			---->dont change AWS SERVICE
			----->select service EC2
				----->new page will open for mentioning permissions;search for cloudwatchfullaccess and select it
					-------->on new page mention Name for Role and Create
	4)goto Ec2 service and select the instance 
			---->Action
			   ----->Security
			       ----->modify IAM role and just select 
	5)On Cli 
		copy the access_log files path location
		vi  /etc/awslogsd/logs/awscli.conf
			mention here ur current region .... and save file
		vi  /etc/awslogsd/logs/awslogs.conf
			update below
			[any_name]
			date-time format= %b %d %H %M %s
			file=/here/paste/the/path
			buffer_duration=5000
			log_stream_name=instance-id 
			initial-position=start-of-file
			log-group-name=name-of-ur-log-group
	6)service awslogsd restart

u can see ur logs are generated in cloudwatch automatically at logs........
