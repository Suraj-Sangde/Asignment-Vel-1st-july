problem statement :- Sends the Notification when any event is happen in running resources

basic idea:- *Event----- Event is nothing but any natural or unnatural changes happened in aws 
                

practical:-1)Here U need to Create SNS Notification. Go to SNS Notification Service 
		-------> Create SNS topic
			------> Create a new topic Name
			          Email endpoints that will receive the notification
			          U need to accept the notification from Gmail so it will notify accordingly
	
	2)For events we need to create rule first
	you can see Event and Rules at left side ----> select Rules
	3)New Page will open for creation of rule
	   Create Rule
		------->Give name for Rule and select Rule with an event pattern

	
New page will open where u need to configure on which Event what will be the action must be taken by cloudwatch
	specify rule:- Event source
			select AWS events or EventBridge partner events 
		    Sample event
			select AWS events
		    Creation method
			select Use pattern form
	-----------	now here need to configure Overall Event-------------- 
			1.Event source------>AWS Services
			2.AWS service------->Ec2 
			3.Event type--------->All Events (Here you can select granular events as well
						like start
						running
						stop
 						reboot etc
			4.New Page will open to Select target For what action must be take
				here we can select multiple target for individual Event
				      Select target type
					------> AWS Service
				      Select Target
					-------> Simple Notification Service
				      Select Topic 
					--------> our topic name	
			5.Finallly Review and Create........


Here .............. if any event happen like running instance is stopped then it will send the notification through email
