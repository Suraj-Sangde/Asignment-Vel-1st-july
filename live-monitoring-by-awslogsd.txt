problem statement--- Whenever there is ERROR triggers in Logs then send Notification to email-id

basic-idea:-global standard of log levels are listed below
		INFO
		DEBUG
		WARN
		ERROR
		FAILURE

Practical:- 1)install httpd and host a file 
		yum install httpd -y
		cd /var/www/html
		vi index.html ------ "This is my webapplication hosted on httpd server"  
		Open port 80 in security grp
		service httpd start
	2)install log agent
		yum install awslogs -y
		service awslogsd start
	3)Create IAM role and attac it to Ec2 instance where application is hosted on httpd and generate the logs with the help of cloudwatchlogs
		In IAM select Role
			--->create role
			---->dont change AWS SERVICE
			----->select service EC2
				----->new page will open for mentioning permissions;search for cloudwatchfullaccess and select it
					-------->on new page mention Name for Role and Create
	4)goto Ec2 service and select the instance 
			---->Action
			   ----->Security
			       ----->modify IAM role and just select 
	5)On Cli 
		copy the access_log files path location
		vi  /etc/awslogsd/logs/awscli.conf
			mention here ur current region .... and save file
		vi  /etc/awslogsd/logs/awslogs.conf
			update below
			[any_name]
			date-time format= %b %d %H %M %s
			file=/here/paste/the/path
			buffer_duration=5000
			log_stream_name=instance-id 
			initial-position=start-of-file
			log-group-name=name-of-ur-log-group
	6)service awslogsd restart

u can see ur logs are generated in cloudwatch automatically at logs........



now select LOG GROUP select Log stream and then Metric filter...
	6)here need to create metric filter for monitoring ERROR 
	------->Create metric filter
	       ---->Define pattern
		-->Filter pattern --> type for ERROR and select it
		Choose log group name
		And then TEST--- this TEST simply checks for the error in the log
		Next
	7)We Need to Assign metric
		Filter name -- any
		Metric filter -- ERROR	
		Metric Namespace-- ERROR
		Metric Name-- ERROR
		Metric Value-- 1 ----> this means that if ERROR found once send the notification
		Now we should know it by SNS notification
		Set up
	8)select topic name
	9)Log Group--- select our Log-group name
	  Threshold Value -- 1
	  In alarm --- send me notification when alarm is IN ALARM state
	  Alarm Name --- Any Name 
------this way you can monitor aws webserver live.......
