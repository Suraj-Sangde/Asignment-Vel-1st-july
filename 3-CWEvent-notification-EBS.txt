problem statement :- Sends the Notification when State of EBS volume gets change

basic idea:- *Event----- Event is nothing but any natural or unnatural changes happened in aws 
                *States of EBS:- attach volume,ceate volume,reattach volume,modify volume,delete volume

practical:-1)Here U need to Create SNS Notification. Go to SNS Notification Service 
		-------> Create SNS topic
			------> Create a new topic Name
			          Email endpoints that will receive the notification
			          U need to accept the notification from Gmail so it will notify accordingly
	
	2)For events we need to create rule first
	you can see Event and Rules at left side ----> select Rules
	3)New Page will open for creation of rule
	   Create Rule
		------->Give name for Rule and select Rule with an event pattern

	New page will open where u need to configure on which Event what will be the action must be taken by cloudwatch
	specify rule:- Event source
			-->select AWS events or EventBridge partner events 
		    Sample event
			-->select AWS events
		    Creation method
			-->select Use pattern form
	-----------	now here need to configure Overall Event-------------- 
			1.Event source------>AWS Services
			2.AWS service------->Ec2 
			3.Event Type-------->EBS Volume notification
			4.Event Type Specification 1--------->All Events (Here you can select granular events as well)
					
 			5.Event Type Specification 2---------->EBS Volume ARN
			6.New Page will open to Select target For what action must be take
				here we can select multiple target for individual Event
				      Select target type
					------> AWS Service
				      Select Target
					-------> Simple Notification Service
				      Select Topic 
					--------> our topic name	
			5.Finallly Review and Create........


Here .............. if any event happen like create new volume and attach to instance then it will send the notification through email
